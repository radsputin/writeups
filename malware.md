# Introduction to Malware
Malware is short for **Mal**acious Soft**ware** and is an umbrella term used to refer to a variety of forms of hostile or intrusive software. Malware covers all programs that aim to cause damage by making electronic data inaccessible, changing it, deleting it or creating access to it for unauthorized third parties. Malware always has a damaging function (called Payload) and has different effects. Malware can be divided into three groups: Trojans, worms and viruses.





## Trojans
Trojans are different from worms and viruses in that they do not independently replicate themselves. Usually disguised as normal or desirable files or programs concealing harmful or malicious executable code.


#### Backdoors
Backdoors provide backdoor access to the infected computer. Once infected, the attacker can gain remote access which allows for the installation of further software such as integration with other computers into a botnet. 
####Adware
Adware records the activities and processes on a computer, such as surfing behaviour in order to display relavant ads or manipulate the results of online searches.
####Spyware
Spyware is used to steal data: passwords, documents, software registration numbers, email addresses and more.
####Downloaders and droppers
Many Trojans have a specific task. The aim of downloaders and droppers is to load or copy a file onto the infected computer. Often they first attempt to reduce the computerâ€™s security settings.

## Viruses
A program usually hidden within another seemingly innocuous program that copies itself by injecting it's code into other programs or files, and that usually performs a malicious action (such as destroying data). They can be divided into the following categories:

####Boot sector viruses
Boot sector or MBR viruses (= master boot record viruses) position themselves at the front of the actual boot sector of data media, thus ensuring that the virus code is read first and then the original boot sector, when the computer boots from this medium. This enables the virus to embed itself in the system undetected and then it also runs when the hard disk boots up. Often the virus code remains in the memory after it has infected the system. These viruses are known as memory-resident. The virus is then passed on by formatting diskettes, thus enabling it to spread to other computers.

####File viruses
Many viruses make use of the chance of hiding themselves in executable files. This is achieved by either deleting or overwriting the host file or by the viruses attaching themselves to the file. In the latter case the executable code in the file remains functional. If the executable file is accessed, the virus code, mostly written in assembly code, starts running first and then the original program opens (if it has not been deleted).

####Multipartite viruses
This type of virus is particularly dangerous, as its representatives not only infect executable files, but also the boot sector (or partition table).

####Macro Viruses
Macro viruses also attach themselves to files. However, they are not in themselves executable. Furthermore, macro viruses are not written in assembly code, but in a macro language such as Visual Basic. The viruses require a macro language interpreter, as found in Word, Excel, Access and PowerPoint, to enable them to run. Otherwise, macro viruses operate in the same ways as file viruses. They can also disguise themselves and in addition contaminate the boot sector or create companion viruses.
####Stealth viruses and rootkits
Stealth or camouflage viruses have special protective mechanisms to escape detection by virus scanning programs. To do this they take control of various system functions. Once this state has been created, these viruses can no longer be detected during normal access to files or system areas. They deceive the virus scanning program into believing a file is not infected or make the file invisible to the virus protection. The camouflage mechanisms of stealth viruses do not start working until the virus is resident in the RAM.
####Polymorphic viruses
Polymorphic viruses contain mechanisms to change their appearance with each infection. To enable them to do this, parts of the virus are encrypted. The encryption routine integrated in the virus generates a new code for each copy and sometimes even new encryption routines. Command sequences that are not required to operate the virus can also be substituted or randomly rearranged. In this way, billions of variants of a virus can easily be created. In order to  be sure to detect and remove encrypted and polymorphic viruses, it is often not enough to use classic virus signatures. In most cases, special programs must be written. The expense required for analysis and to prepare suitable countermeasures can be extremely high. Thus, when it comes to viruses, polymorphic viruses may truly be regarded as belonging to the premier league.


## Worms
Similar to viruses in that they replicate functional copies of themselves and can cause the same type of damage. In contrast to viruses, which require the spreading of an infected host file, worms are standalone software and do not require a host program or human help to propagate.


####Network worms

Several ports on randomly selected network computers are scanned and, if an attack is possible, the weak points in the protocols or their implementation are used to spread the worm.

####Email worms
A worm spread via email can use the available email programs (e.g. Outlook, Outlook Express) or it may bring its own SMTP mail engine with it. Aside from the resulting network traffic and the increased use of system resources, worms may contain other harmful payloads.
####Peer-to-peer worms
P2P worms copy themselves into the sharing files of P2P file sharing services and wait for potential victims with enticing file names of current software etc.
